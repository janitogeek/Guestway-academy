# Inbox

### Inbox Tab

The Inbox tab in the Guestway App serves as a centralized hub for all reservation-related communications. It offers a clear and organized view of every conversation connected to guest bookings, allowing you to easily track messages, respond promptly, and stay fully updated on any guest requests or changes. This streamlined communication tool helps improve coordination between managers, cleaning teams, and guests, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow.

#### Message Preview

Each message preview in the Inbox provides comprehensive details designed to give you a clear and immediate understanding of each reservation and its communication status:

* **Reservation Status:** This shows the current phase of the guest’s stay, such as “Check-in today”, or “Currently hosting”. These status labels help prioritize responses and anticipate upcoming tasks or issues related to the guest’s visit.
* **Listing Name and ID:** Every message is linked to a specific property, identified by its unique nickname and ID number. This ensures you can quickly associate communications with the correct listing, especially important when managing multiple properties, avoiding confusion, and allowing for precise follow-up actions.
* **Guest Name:** The guest’s full name is displayed prominently to help you recognize who you’re communicating with. This personalizes the interaction and helps when cross-referencing reservations or addressing specific guest needs directly.
* **Stay Dates:** The check-in and check-out dates for the booking are shown, providing context about the guest’s length of stay and timing. This information is crucial for scheduling cleaning tasks, planning guest services, and responding appropriately based on how soon the guest will arrive or has departed.
* **Time of Last Message:** The timestamp of the most recent message indicates how current the conversation is. This helps you identify urgent or stale threads and prioritize replies to maintain timely communication with guests and team members.
* **Message Preview or Status:** A brief excerpt of the latest message is displayed to give a snapshot of the conversation’s content without opening the full thread. If no messages have been exchanged yet, the status “No messages yet” is shown, signaling that outreach or follow-up might be needed.

This structured layout streamlines your workflow by letting you quickly grasp the status and needs of each booking at a glance, ensuring nothing slips through the cracks.

#### AI-Generated Draft Suggestions

One of the most powerful features within the Inbox is the AI-generated reply suggestions. When the communication team opens a guest message, the app automatically analyzes the content and generates a suggested response tailored to the inquiry.

This feature significantly speeds up response times while ensuring that replies maintain a professional, polite, and consistent tone across all interactions. It’s especially useful for handling common questions, requests, or updates efficiently.

The communication team has full control and can choose to:

* **Send the AI-generated reply as-is** – Ideal for standard questions or when the suggestion fits perfectly.
* **Edit the suggestion before sending** – Allows customization while still saving time.
* **Write a completely custom response** – Best for complex or sensitive situations that require a personal touch.

By offering these flexible options, AI-generated drafts help streamline communication workflows without sacrificing quality.

#### Who Can Respond?

Only the **communication team** is authorized to reply directly to guest messages within the Inbox. This ensures that all guest communication maintains a consistent, professional tone and is handled by trained team members.

#### Internal Notes (for Staff)

While other staff members — such as cleaners, supervisors, or operations personnel — cannot message guests directly, they can leave internal notes. These notes are highlighted in yellow and are visible only to the internal team, not to guests.

Internal notes are useful for:

* Summarizing phone or in-person conversations with guests
* Reporting any issues, unusual situations, or guest-related feedback
* Flagging important updates or actions needed for follow-up

Using internal notes helps improve coordination across teams and ensures that everyone stays informed without disrupting the guest experience.
