# Message Controls and Status

## Message Type

Just below the message reply bar, you’ll find a set of icons that simplify message management by clearly showing the source of each message. This helps you easily identify where messages are coming from and choose the channel through which you want to send your replies.

#### PMS / Guestway Communication

From this dropdown menu, you have the option to select how you want to send your message—either through your Property Management System (PMS) or directly via Guestway. This flexibility allows you to choose the most convenient or effective communication channel based on your workflow and the guest’s preferences.

#### Airbnb Icon

This icon indicates that the conversation is happening through the Airbnb platform. Any message you send will be delivered directly to the guest via Airbnb’s messaging system.

#### WhatsApp Icon&#x20;

This icon appears only when the guest’s most recent response was sent via WhatsApp. It indicates that any further messages you send will be delivered through WhatsApp, ensuring the conversation continues seamlessly on the same platform the guest prefers.

#### Text Message Icon

When this icon is visible, it means your message will be sent to the guest via standard SMS instead of the booking platform’s messaging system. This helps ensure your message reaches the guest directly on their mobile device.

#### Email Icon&#x20;

When this icon is visible, your message will be sent via email instead of the booking platform’s messaging system, ensuring it reaches the guest’s inbox directly.

#### Internal Note Icon

This feature allows you to leave notes for internal use only, visible to your team but not to the guest. This ensures smooth internal communication, helps avoid misunderstandings, and keeps everyone aligned.

#### Saved Replies

You can insert saved replies that have been pre-written for each listing. These are useful for responding quickly to common questions or situations. These are especially useful for responding quickly and consistently to common questions or recurring situations.

#### AI Button:&#x20;

The AI button assists in creating clear and effective responses by automatically suggesting improvements or generating complete replies based on the conversation. This saves time, ensures consistent tone and professionalism, and helps you respond accurately in complex or sensitive situations.

#### Reply Button

To send a message, you must click the “Reply” button. Pressing Enter alone will not send the message.

Each conversation in the system is assigned a status that reflects the current stage of the guest’s booking or stay. These statuses help you quickly understand where the guest is in their journey, enabling timely and appropriate communication.

_Inquiry:_ The guest has submitted an inquiry but has not yet confirmed or paid for the reservation.
