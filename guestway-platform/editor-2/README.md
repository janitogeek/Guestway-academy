# Unified AI Inbox&#x20;

Clicking on Inbox opens a centralized view of all guest conversations. It connects directly to your property management system (PMS), so messages from platforms like Airbnb, Booking.com, and Vrbo are automatically synced. This allows you to manage all communication from one place, making it easier to stay organized and respond promptly.&#x20;

### Inbox Filters&#x20;

The Unified Inbox is equipped with a powerful search and filtering system that helps you quickly find the exact conversation or reservation you’re looking for. Whether you’re managing a handful of listings or a large portfolio, this feature saves time and improves response efficiency.

You can search by keywords or apply filters to narrow down conversations based on a wide range of criteria. Filter by the assigned team member, listing or listing nickname, multi-units and their nicknames, or even by complex. You can also search by guest name, host or owner details, booking channel, or performance metrics such as satisfaction score and risk score.

Additional filters let you refine your view using reservation specifics like night count, total guest count, and even location data such as city or ZIP code. With these flexible options, the Unified Inbox becomes a smart tool that adapts to your workflow—helping you stay organized, responsive, and in control.

#### Needs Reply

The “Needs Reply” button displays all conversations that are still awaiting a response. It’s a useful way to ensure no messages go unanswered and helps maintain timely communication with guests.

#### Flagged

Clicking on “Flagged” brings up conversations marked for special attention. These often involve more complex matters—such as cancellations, refund requests, or guest complaints—and are typically reviewed by supervisors.
