# Listing

This section gives you a comprehensive snapshot of the property linked to each reservation. Instantly view the listing’s nickname and full title as set in your property management system, so you can identify the unit at a glance. You’ll also find key details—property type, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, maximum guest capacity, and the full property address—making it easy for staff or partners to locate the unit for cleaning, maintenance, or guest support.

Additionally, all guidebooks created and linked to the listing are right at your fingertips. These can be PDFs, URLs, or text documents, and can be accessed by the operator in one click and shared with the guest in just two clicks. Of course, guests can also access these guidebooks directly from their Guest App for a seamless experience.

Having all this essential information in one place streamlines operational coordination, supports accurate guest communication, and ensures everyone—staff and guests alike—has what they need for a smooth stay.
