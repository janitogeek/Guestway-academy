# Access

This section contains all the information related to accessing the unit, including the locks assigned to it. Typically, this includes the main building door, the apartment door, and a backup keybox for emergencies. From this panel, you can also regenerate access codes or disable all locks when needed.

### **View codes**

Display the current access codes assigned to the guest for each lock. This lets you see which codes the guest is using to enter different doors, helping you keep track of their access.

### **Re-generate codes**

Create new access codes that replace the old ones. This is useful for improving security or updating access after a guest checks out or if you suspect the codes have been compromised

### Extend access&#x20;

Change the time period that the guest’s access codes are valid. This is helpful for allowing early check-ins or late check-outs without issuing new codes.

### Disable all locks&#x20;

Immediately turn off all active access codes for the unit. This action is important if there’s a security issue or if the guest cancels, ensuring no one can enter using the old codes.
