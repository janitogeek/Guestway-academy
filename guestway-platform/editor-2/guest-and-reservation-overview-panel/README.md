# Guest and Reservation Overview Panel

On the right side of Guestway, you’ll find detailed information about the guest’s reservation. At the top, the reservation number and status are clearly displayed, along with quick links to open the reservation in your property management system and to access the guest portal for further details.&#x20;

This section is designed to give you a comprehensive overview, not only of the reservation itself but also of related key areas. You can easily access detailed information about the listing, including property specifics; guest details, such as profiles and contact information; access info like smart lock codes and entry permissions; and tasks related to cleaning or maintenance. All of these elements are conveniently organized in one place, allowing you to manage and monitor every aspect of the guest’s stay efficiently and seamlessly.
