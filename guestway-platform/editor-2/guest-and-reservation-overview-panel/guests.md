# Guests

The Guests section offers a comprehensive overview of the person who made the reservation. It provides valuable insights into the guest’s background, verification status, and contact details, helping you better understand who is staying in your property.&#x20;

### General Snapshot&#x20;

It includes their full name, profile photo from Airbnb, the length of time they’ve been active on the platform, and their location. You can also see verification statuses for their email, identity, and phone number. Additionally, the panel shows the guest’s hometown, preferred language, email address, and phone number. If a smart lock with license plate recognition is set up for the property, that information will be displayed here as well.

### The risk score

The risk score is calculated using various details about the reservation and the guest, such as booking lead time, presence of children, average stay length, and verification of identity and phone number. Reviews from previous stays also play a role. This score helps property managers assess guest reliability and flag potentially risky bookings, helping to prevent issues like property damage or cancellations.&#x20;

Note that the score may not be available for all reservations if the OTA doesn’t provide enough data. However, when enough relevant information is available, the system will automatically generate a score.

### Satisfaction Score

The satisfaction score helps evaluate the guest’s mood and overall experience during their stay. It is generated using AI that analyzes the tone, language, and sentiment in guest messages throughout the reservation. A positive score indicates a satisfied guest, while a negative or neutral score may suggest potential issues or dissatisfaction.
