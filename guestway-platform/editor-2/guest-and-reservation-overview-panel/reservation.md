### Services

Services are used to inform the cleaning team about any special items or specific setups required in the guest’s unit, such as a baby bed or other amenities. You can view all the services that have already been added for a reservation, ensuring that all necessary arrangements are in place.

To add a new service, simply click the ‘+’ icon. Please note that services can only be added before the guest’s check-in date. Depending on how the service templates are configured, you might be restricted from making changes to these services during the guest’s stay. However, some templates allow modifications at any time if needed, offering flexibility to accommodate last-minute requests.

* Light Green: Indicates other confirmed reservations for different guests, either in the past or upcoming. This helps with planning future cleanings, guest prep, and availability forecasting.
* White: Shows open dates when the listing is not reserved and is fully available for new bookings. This helps quickly spot opportunities for new reservations
* Orange: Marks dates for which a guest has submitted an inquiry or booking request that hasn’t been confirmed yet. These dates are on hold and may convert into actual bookings.
* Red: Identifies dates that were previously booked but have since been canceled. Useful for tracking booking changes, re-opening dates, and evaluating cancellation trends.
