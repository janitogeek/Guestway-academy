# Guest Conversations&#x20;

This section displays the full conversation thread with the guest, along with a set of tools to help you manage and follow up efficiently. You can assign messages, control translations, set reminders, mute notifications, and flag conversations that need attention.

### **Guest Info and Assignment**

At the top of the screen, the guest’s name is displayed. Clicking the icon next to it opens the full conversation directly in your connected PMS.&#x20;

If the conversation is marked as “Unassigned,” you can use the dropdown menu to assign it to the appropriate team member.

### Conversation Timing Controls

Clicking on “Mute Until” allows you to temporarily silence notifications for this conversation until a specified time. This helps reduce distractions while still keeping the thread accessible.

Use the “Remind Me” option to set a reminder for following up on the conversation later, helping you stay on top of important messages.

### Toggle Translation

You can turn translation on or off depending on your preference. By default, conversations are translated into English, but you can choose to view the guest’s original language if needed.

### Conversation Flags and Responses

Marking a conversation as “Needs Reply” flags it as requiring a response, making it easy to identify messages from guests that still need your attention.

Use the flag option to mark conversations that need special attention or review by a supervisor, typically for cases involving disputes, complaints, or other sensitive matters.
