# Review Center

The Review Center is a centralized dashboard designed to help property managers and hospitality teams manage guest feedback efficiently. It brings together reviews from various booking platforms, analyzes them using AI, and offers tools to improve guest satisfaction, team performance, and operational excellence.&#x20;

### Filter and Manage Reviews

The Review Center provides a comprehensive set of filters to quickly find and manage specific reviews.

You can refine the dashboard view based on options such as _Assigned To, Replied By, Listing, Multi-Unit, Complex, City, ZIP Code, Overall Rating, Deleted by Guest, Satisfaction Score, and Guest Name_. These advanced filters make it easy to isolate specific types of reviews, monitor performance at both the individual and property level, and surface trends based on location, guest satisfaction, or internal handling.

The dashboard also includes quick-access buttons located at the top of the interface. These allow you to instantly view reviews that are _Assigned to you_, _Need a Reply,_ or have been _Flagged_ for additional attention.

### Detailed Feedback

When you open a specific review, the dashboard displays a breakdown of guest ratings across key categories: _Check-in, Accuracy, Cleanliness, Communication, Location, and Value_. Each score is accompanied by a percentage showing how this individual rating compares to previous reviews—indicating performance trends (positive or negative). This section helps hosts and property managers quickly pinpoint areas that are improving or declining over time.

### Tracking Cleaning Performance

In the Cleaning section, the dashboard identifies the cleaner assigned to the booking, shows their individual rating, and highlights any negative trends. For example, a drop in cleaning scores or recurring cleanliness issues are flagged, allowing you to assess whether the problem may be due to a specific team member or a broader operational issue. This kind of transparency supports more informed quality control and staff training.

### Tracking Communication Performance

The Communication block shows which team members interacted with the guest and how many messages were sent during the booking. Each person’s communication rating is shown alongside their historical performance. This allows managers to evaluate the quality and consistency of guest interactions and ensure high service standards are being maintained across the team.

### Chat Analysis

The Chat Analysis panel uses AI to scan the conversation between the guest and host, extracting key themes and sentiments.This automated insight helps teams quickly understand what the guest experienced without manually reading through entire message threads.

### Review Summary

This section condenses the guest’s review into a set of clearly structured bullet points—separated into positive and negative observations. It makes it easy to see the highlights and concerns of the review at a glance, which is especially useful when analyzing large volumes of feedback or preparing internal reports.&#x20;

### AI-Generated Replies

The Review Center also features AI-generated replies to streamline the review response process. Based on the review content and detected sentiment, the AI can suggest personalized, polite, and professional replies that can be used as-is or edited before posting. This tool saves time, ensures consistent tone, and helps maintain a high level of guest engagement.
