# Personal Settings

The **Personal Settings** area allows each user to configure their own account according to their preferences. It includes three key sections: Profile, Preferences, and Organizations Overview.

In the **Profile** section, you can view and manage your personal information. This includes your first and last name, email address, and the option to upload a profile picture.&#x20;

There’s also a "Reset Password" button that allows you to change your password securely whenever needed.

Under **Preferences**, you can personalize the look and feel of the platform by choosing between light mode and dark mode.&#x20;

The **Organizations Overview** page provides a quick summary of all the organizations you have chosen to connect to Guestway. From here, you can easily switch between different organizations and manage access where necessary.

You can also create a new organization by clicking on "+ Create", but you’ll need to contact the Guestway team to complete the setup
