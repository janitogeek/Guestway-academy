# Multi-Calendar

When you click on the **Multi-Calendar** icon in your property management dashboard, you're taken to a powerful visual interface designed to help you manage all your properties and reservations at a glance.

This view is organized by month, allowing you to monitor availability, bookings, and turnover status across all listings in a single place.

In each _horizontal row_, you can see a different rental unit or listing. Each listing is labeled with an internal nickname that uniquely identifies the property and is paired with a thumbnail image for easy recognition. Next to the image, a small status icon indicates the current cleaning state of the unit.

In the _vertical columns_, you can see each day of the selected month laid out from left to right. This daily structure lets you monitor bookings and availability at a glance. A vertical red line highlights today’s date, helping you stay focused on the current schedule.

In the calendar grid, you can see _blue bars_ that represent confirmed guest reservations. The length of each bar shows how many nights the guest is staying, and the guest’s name appears inside the bar. Some bars also include a platform icon, showing whether the booking came from Airbnb, Booking.com, or a direct source.

If you hover your cursor over a blue bar, a quick summary of the reservation appears. This includes the OTA used for booking, the total number of nights, the exact check-in and check-out days and times, the listing nickname, the name of the guest, and the total number of guests. This quick preview helps you access key information without  opening the full reservation.
