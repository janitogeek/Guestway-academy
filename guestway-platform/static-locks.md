# Static Locks

From this page, you can view a complete list of all static locks connected to your account. Each lock is displayed with key details, including its name, the type of door it’s installed on, the complex or unit it belongs to, the associated listing name, and the assigned PIN code. This organized overview helps you manage non-digital or manually configured locks with ease.

Each row in this panel is interactive: by clicking on a row (such as the lock name or door name), you can open a field for editing or view more details.

The _**Information**_ section provides a detailed overview of the static lock's configuration and status. At the top, you’ll find the _lock’s custom name_, which can be edited by clicking the pencil icon, and just below, the lock type is shown.&#x20;

You’ll also see the specific door location where the lock is installed. The section includes the associated PIN code used to open the lock; the code is hidden by default for security reasons but can be revealed by clicking the eye icon.&#x20;

Lastly, there's a visibility setting that tells you whether the lock is currently visible to guests. If set to "No," it means guests won’t see this lock in their check-in instructions. All of this information is centralized in one place for easy management and quick reference.

The _**Linked Complexes**_ section shows whether the lock is associated with any building complexes or grouped property units. If you manage properties within a larger complex or group, you can easily associate this lock by clicking the **“+” icon**, which opens the option to link a relevant complex. This helps in organizing your properties and managing locks at scale.

The Linked Listings area lists the individual property listings that this lock is currently connected to. This connection ensures the correct property has access to the lock. You can either add more listings using the **“+” icon** or unlink an existing listing by clicking the unlink icon next to it.

Finally, the Manage section at the bottom includes the _**Delete Lock**_ option. Clicking this allows you to permanently remove the lock from your account. This is useful if the device is no longer in use or has been replaced.

### How to create a new static lock?

To create a new static lock, simply click on the “+” button. You’ll be prompted to complete a few essential fields:

1. Assign a _**name**_ to the lock so it can be easily recognized later. This helps with quick identification, especially when managing multiple locks.
2. Specify the _**door name**_, which indicates the physical location of the lock—such as “Apartment Door,” “Main Gate,” or “Side Entrance.” This detail ensures clarity for both guests and staff.
3. Enter the _**PIN code**_ that users will input to open the lock. Choose a secure numeric sequence that’s easy to manage and share.
4. Set the _**visible**_ status to determine if the lock should appear in the guest portal. If marked visible, guests will see it as part of their check-in instructions; if not, it remains hidden for internal use.
5. Select the _**lock type**_ so the system can correctly recognize and manage the static device
6. Link the lock to the appropriate _**listing**_ by selecting it from your list of properties. This connects the lock to a specific rental unit, ensuring guests receive the correct access.
