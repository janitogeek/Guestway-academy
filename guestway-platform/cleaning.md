# Cleaning

### Cleaning Dashboard Overview

The platform includes a dedicated Cleaning Dashboard that offers a clear overview of how your cleaning teams are organized. This overview is useful because it helps managers quickly understand team assignments and coverage, facilitates better communication with cleaning partners, and simplifies planning and resource management. This page is organized into three distinct columns:&#x20;

* In the first column, you’ll find the name of the cleaning company or team responsible for the cleaning services.
* The second column serves as a description field where you can add internal notes.
* The third column, provides a comprehensive list of all the properties currently assigned to each cleaning company or team.

Having all this information centralized makes daily operations smoother and more efficient.
