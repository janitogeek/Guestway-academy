# Service Templates

The _Service Templates_ page allows you to define and standardize recurring services that may be needed before, during, or after a guest’s stay. These templates act as predefined service configurations that can be quickly added to reservations or triggered based on specific conditions—ensuring consistent quality, smoother operations, and reduced manual input.

On the Service Templates dashboard, each row represents a predefined service and is organized into key columns:

* _Service Name_: The title of the service (e.g., “Extra Towels”, “Baby Bed”).
* _Max Amount_: The maximum quantity that can be assigned per reservation.
* _Category:_ Classifies the service as either Consumables (e.g., toilet paper, shower gel) or Amenities (e.g., cribs, high chairs).
* _Type:_ Specifies the exact item or service being provided, such as toilet paper, cribs, or shower gel.
* _Manual Assign:_ Indicates if the service can be manually added by staff.
* _Auto Assign:_ Indicates if the service is automatically added based on rules or reservation criteria.

### How to Create a New Service Template

In the Service Templates section, you can create new templates using the button located at the top of the page

1. Click on the "+ Create" button.&#x20;
2. On the "Information" page, you can set all the essential details that define your new service:

* **Name**: Choose a clear, concise, and descriptive name that instantly conveys what the service is
* **Description:** Add a brief explanation or special notes about the service
* **Category:** Select the category that best fits your service. You can choose from:
  * _Consumables_ – Items that get used up, such as toiletries, paper goods, or snacks.
  * _Accommodation_ – Services directly related to preparing or managing the stay, like late check-out or room upgrades.
  * _Amenities_ – Reusable guest conveniences, such as cribs, fans, or extra pillows.
  * _Other_ – For services that don’t fall under the categories above.
* **Type:** Specify the exact item or service type within the category (e.g., “toilet paper,” “shower gel,” “crib”).
* **Show in Cleaning Task:** Enable this option if you want the service to appear in the cleaner’s task list, ensuring it’s included in their workflow.

3. On the "Availability" page, you define when and how your service will be triggered during a guest’s stay:

* **Trigger Type:** Choose the timing that best fits your service:
  * _Arrival:_ The service will be executed before guest check-in.
  * _Departure:_ Scheduled to occur after guest checkout.
  * _Daily:_ The service repeats every day throughout the guest’s stay.
  * _Always:_ The service is available at any time and can be assigned whenever needed.
* **Deliver on Next Day:** Enable this option if the service should be carried out one day after the trigger event.&#x20;

4. On the "Amount" page, you specify the quantity limits and how the service is assigned to reservations.

* **Max Amount (Supply)**: Set the maximum number of units available for each stay. This prevents over-allocation and helps manage your stock effectively.
* **Manual Assign:** Enable this option if you want team members to have the flexibility to assign the service manually when needed.
* **Auto Assign:** Turn this on to have the system automatically assign the service based on the availability and trigger rules you defined earlier.

5. After creating and saving your new service template on the Link page, a summary link will automatically appear.

* Select and connect the exact listings you want to associate with this service. This ensures that the service will be applied to the correct properties or units in your portfolio.
* Choose which smart locks you want to link to the selected listings.&#x20;
* If you use static locks, you can also assign them here.&#x20;

By following these simple steps, you create powerful, reusable service templates that help your team save time, reduce errors, and deliver a consistently excellent guest experience.
