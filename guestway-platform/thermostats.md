# Thermostats

The Thermostats Connected page provides a clear and organized overview of all thermostats currently linked to your account.&#x20;

Each thermostat is displayed with a default icon, making the list easy to scan. Alongside the icon, you’ll find the thermostat’s unique identity code, the name of the listing where it is installed, its connection status (indicating whether it’s online or offline), and the battery status (charged or not).

At the top of the page, you can use the Refresh button to update the device list in real time, and switch between Grid or Table view to better suit your preferences when browsing the thermostats.

Clicking on a specific thermostat from the Thermostats page opens a detailed view that offers real-time and historical data, along with control options for that device.&#x20;

This page helps you monitor performance and environmental conditions while allowing limited adjustments if the thermostat is set to “Managed” mode.

### Device Information

In the left panel of the Thermostat Detail View, you’ll find a comprehensive summary of the device’s identity, operational status, and configuration settings. This section helps you monitor key details at a glance and manage the thermostat’s behavior remotely.

* _Device Name and Room:_ This identifies the thermostat and its physical location within the property.&#x20;
* _Device Type:_ Displays the brand or model of the thermostat, such as “Nest.” Knowing the device type allows you to better understand its capabilities, compatibility with Guestway.
* Status: Shows whether the thermostat is currently online or offline. A green “Online” status indicates the thermostat is actively connected and transmitting data, while an “Offline” status may require attention or troubleshooting to restore connectivity.
* Uptime Bar: Provides a visual representation of the thermostat’s connectivity over the past 30 days. The horizontal bar is segmented by day and color-coded, helping you identify patterns in uptime performance.&#x20;
* The Settings section allows you to view and control how the thermostat operates within its assigned listing.
  * Listing Name: This section displays the name of the listing where the thermostat is installed, helping you quickly identify its location within your property portfolio.
  * Managed Mode Toggle: This switch lets you choose whether the thermostat is controlled automatically by Guestway. When enabled, the device will follow automated rules, such as adjusting settings based on check-ins and check-outs. If disabled, all thermostat settings must be managed manually by staff or guests.
  * Max Heating Temperature: Here you can set a maximum temperature limit (e.g., 23°C). This cap ensures that heating cannot exceed the defined value, promoting energy efficiency and preventing overheating during periods of vacancy or mild weather.

### Temperature and Humidity Charts

The center panel provides a real-time visual overview of environmental conditions, making it easier to monitor and analyze the indoor climate.

You can filter the data displayed in this section by selecting different time ranges using the dropdown in the top-right corner of the panel. Available options include Last 24 Hours, Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, and Last 3 Months, allowing you to analyze short-term trends or review long-term climate performance.

* _Temperature Graph:_ This chart displays two key data sets—current temperature and target heating temperature—plotted over time. \
  \
  The green line indicates the actual temperature in the room, offering insight into how the environment is behaving. \
  The red dashed line represents the target temperature set by the thermostat, helping you identify how closely the system is following heating commands. \
  \
  This comparison is especially useful for evaluating system responsiveness or identifying any temperature fluctuations during occupancy.
* _Humidity Graph:_ This graph shows the humidity level variations across the same 24-hour period. \
  \
  A consistent line helps verify climate stability, while any sudden spikes or drops may signal issues like poor ventilation or high moisture events (e.g., long showers, open windows). \
  \
  Monitoring humidity supports guest comfort and helps prevent issues related to mold or condensation.

### Manual Controls

The right-hand side of the Thermostat Detail View features an intuitive control panel designed for manual interaction with the thermostat—ideal for quick adjustments or direct intervention when automated settings are disabled.

* _Power Button:_ Located at the top of the dial interface, this button allows you to manually toggle the heating system on or off.&#x20;
* _Temperature Dial:_ At the center is a circular digital dial that allows you to set the desired room temperature manually. Simply rotate the dial to increase or decrease the target temperature within the allowed range (which is restricted if a max temperature has been configured in the settings). \
  \
  This provides a user-friendly way to override automated rules temporarily or tailor the environment to a specific guest’s comfort level.
* _Current Readings:_ Just below the dial, you’ll see real-time temperature data. The current temperature reflects the actual ambient condition in the room, while the target temperature indicates the heating goal that the system is working toward. \
  \
  This clear contrast helps users immediately understand whether the system is heating, cooling, or maintaining the set level.\
