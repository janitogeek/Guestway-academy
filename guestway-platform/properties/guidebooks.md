On the Properties page, you can create **digital guidebooks** that guests can access through their **personal guest portal (web app)**.

Guidebooks can be uploaded in different formats:

* **PDFs** (detailed manuals, maps, welcome packs)
* **Links** (to websites, Google Maps lists, or external resources)
* **Text files** (quick info like Wi-Fi codes or house rules)

They can include:

* **Local recommendations**: Curated lists of restaurants, caf√©s, bars, and attractions nearby.
* **House rules**: Custom-written guidelines specific to each property.
* **Check-in/out instructions**: Clear directions, including smart lock access codes if integrated.
* **Practical info**: Wi-Fi password, parking details, waste sorting, or anything else relevant to the stay.

All guidebooks are **mobile-friendly, fully branded**, and accessible anytime by your guests.\
This ensures they always have the right information at their fingertips, reducing repetitive questions and improving their overall experience.
