# Properties

#### 🏡 **Guidebook Creation for Guest Portal**

On each property page, you can create digital guidebooks that guests can access through their personal **guest portal** (web app). These guidebooks will be PDFs, links or text and they can include any information you want to share with your guests like:

* **Local recommendations**: Curated lists of things to do, restaurants, bars, and attractions around the property.
* **House rules**: Custom-written guidelines specific to each property.
* **Check-in/out instructions**: Including access code information via smart locks (if integrated).

Everything is mobile-friendly and fully branded.

#### 💬 **Saved Replies Management**

In addition to guest content, this page lets you manage **Saved Replies**:

* These are pre-written templates used in guest conversations (via Airbnb, Booking.com, Vrbo, WhatsApp, SMS, or email).
* Saved replies help you answer frequently asked questions faster — e.g., WiFi code, parking info, cancellation policies.
* You can **create new replies** or edit existing ones for each listing or organization.
* Replies created in your PMS will automatically sync into Guestway’s unified inbox.

This ensures your team provides consistent, fast, and accurate responses across all communication channels.

#### 🎯 Why it matters

This dual functionality of the Properties page bridges **guest experience** and **team efficiency**:

* Guests feel welcomed and informed.
* Teams reduce repetitive work and reply time.
* Brand consistency is maintained across every stay.
