# Smart Locks

The **Smart Locks** page offers a clear and structured overview of all smart locks currently linked to your account.

Each lock is displayed with a default icon, along with key details such as the lock’s unique identity code, the name of the listing where it is installed, and the specific location of the lock&#x20;

You can also view the connection status (whether the lock is online or offline) and the battery level to ensure the device is functional and accessible.

At the top of the page, you can use the Refresh button to update the list, and toggle between Grid and Table view depending on your preferred layout.

### Lock Details and Configuration

The left side of the interface provides a comprehensive summary of your smart lock's current status, settings, and linkages within your property management system.

The _**Lock Header**_ displays the custom name of the lock along with its brand. A status label shows whether the lock is currently online. You can also rename the device or edit its settings.

Moving down, the _**Device Components**_ section displays whether essential peripherals are active and connected. For example, the keypad status indicates if the external keypad is properly linked and operational, while the door sensor status confirms whether the sensor is online and able to detect door state changes like open or closed.

In the _**Actions**_ area, administrators are provided with a direct control option labeled “Open Door.” This feature enables authorized users to remotely unlock the door from the platform without needing to physically be present.

The _**Location**_ section shows where the lock has been installed within the property. A label such as “Apartment door” gives clear context about which entry point the device controls.&#x20;

Under _**Guest Access Settings**,_ there are several toggles that define how and when guests can interact with the smart lock.

* “Guest Can Open Remotely,” allows guests to unlock the door using their phones or digital access.&#x20;
* The “Prevent Access Until Checked-in” toggle ensures that guests cannot use their access credentials until their official check-in time begins.
* "Lastly, the “Revoke Access on Check-out” option automatically disables guest access once their stay has ended, enhancing security and automation.

_**Device Health**_ provides an overview of the lock’s performance. It shows uptime as a percentage and visual timeline, and it tracks battery level with a 30-day graph to help monitor power usage.

The _**Linkage**_ section shows which listings the lock is connected to and whether it’s part of a larger complex. You can easily link or unlink the lock from any listing.

### Activity Logs Panel&#x20;

The **Activity Logs** panel offers a real-time timeline of everything that happens with the smart lock. This chronological view helps you monitor all interactions—whether done manually, through the keypad, or via remote access. Each entry is time-stamped, giving you full traceability and control.

You’ll see entries marked as **"Manually"**, which refer to physical actions such as someone unlocking or locking the door by hand, or the door being opened or closed without the use of an access code.

Events labeled **"Keypad"** show interactions involving the keypad, like when someone locks or unlocks the door using a specific code. These entries help confirm when and how authorized access occurred.

If the log says **"Access with Code"**, it identifies which code was used—whether it’s a manual code set up by an admin or a fallback code automatically generated by the system. This gives insight into who entered and when.

In case of a hardware problem, you may see a **"Motor Blocked"** message, signaling that the lock mechanism encountered a physical issue during operation. These warnings are important for maintenance and troubleshooting.

Every log item includes a **Date and Time** stamp, ensuring you have accurate records of each event. Whether it's a guest arriving late at night or a cleaner entering mid-day, you’ll always know who accessed the property and when.

### Access Codes and Scheduling

The **Access Codes** section provides a complete list of all digital codes that have been generated for the selected smart lock. Each code is displayed along with its unique identifier, making it easy to distinguish between entries. \
\
Next to the code name, an intuitive icon indicates whether the code was generated automatically by the system, created manually by a user, or issued as a fallback.

Next to each code, you'll see its _**Active Status**_, which tells you whether the code is currently enabled and usable. If a code is expired or deactivated, this status will indicate it clearly, helping avoid confusion or unauthorized entry.

The _**Duration**_ column outlines how long each code is valid. Some codes may be marked as “Always,” meaning they work at any time without restrictions, while others are only active for a limited period—ideal for guest stays, maintenance visits, or temporary staff.

For each code, you can click the eye icon to reveal the actual access code, or click the three-dot menu to delete or disable it as needed.

Below the codes list, the _**Schedule Overview**_ section provides a quick summary of scheduled access linked to users or guests.

### How can you create a new access code?

To create a new access code, simply click on the “+ ” button. You’ll be prompted to fill out three essential fields:&#x20;

1. Assign a **name** to the code so it’s easy to identify later (e.g., Cleaner, Guest, or Maintenance).&#x20;
2. Enter the **PIN code**—this is the numeric sequence the guest or user will use to unlock the door.&#x20;
3. Define the **duration** by selecting a start and end date (and time, if needed), which sets the period during which the code will be active.

Once saved, the code will appear in the access list with all relevant details and status indicators.
