# Reservation Panel

This tab provides a comprehensive record of every reservation you have ever received. You can easily access important details such as the reservation number, current status, listing information, guest name, check-in and check-out dates, and the outstanding reservation balance.

You can filter the page to focus on different categories:

### Reservations

Displays the full list of all reservations, regardless of date or status. This is your go-to view for reviewing the entire booking history, identifying trends, or managing future stays. It’s ideal for tracking long-term performance and ensuring no reservation is overlooked.

### Arrivals Today

Shows all guests scheduled to check in on the current day. This view helps front desk or operations teams prepare for arrivals by confirming booking details, assigning units, and ensuring everything is ready for the guest’s stay.

### Departures Today

Lists all reservations checking out today. This section is useful for coordinating housekeeping, preparing for new check-ins, and identifying any last-minute issues or pending balances before guests leave.

### Currently Staying

Highlights all active reservations where guests are currently on-site. This view is helpful for monitoring in-house guests, managing requests, or quickly accessing booking information for ongoing stays.
