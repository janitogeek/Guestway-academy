### How to Connect WhatsApp

Connecting WhatsApp to Guestway requires authentication using your WhatsApp Business API credentials—specifically, a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. This ensures a secure connection while enabling seamless guest messaging.

**How to connect WhatsApp:**

1. **Go to Organization Settings**\
   In your Guestway dashboard, open the settings for the organization you want to connect.
2. **Open the Integrations Tab**\
   Navigate to the “Integrations” section.
3. **Click on “Create”**\
   Select “Create” to add a new integration.
4. **Choose WhatsApp**\
   Select **WhatsApp** from the list of supported communication channels.
5. **Enter Client ID and Client Secret**
   * You will be prompted to enter your WhatsApp Business API **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
   * These credentials are provided by your WhatsApp Business provider or Meta Business Manager.
6. **Authenticate and Connect**\
   Once you input the credentials, Guestway will authenticate your WhatsApp Business account and establish the connection.
7. **Complete Setup**\
   After successful authentication, your WhatsApp channel will be live in Guestway. You can now send and receive messages directly through the Unified Inbox.

**That’s it!**\
Your WhatsApp integration is ready to enhance guest communication—centralized, fast, and efficient.

> **Tip:**\
> Keep your Client ID and Client Secret secure. If you encounter issues, verify credentials with your WhatsApp Business provider or contact Guestway support.
