# E-mail Forwarding

To Do



In _**Email Forwarding**_, you can manage how your OTA-related emails are handled.&#x20;

The _Email Reception_ feature provides you with a unique Guestway email address that can be added to platforms like Airbnb or Booking.com. When those platforms send reservation or guest communication emails, Guestway will automatically receive and process them.

The _Email Forwarding_ feature allows you to define a destination email address where Guestway will forward all incoming messagesâ€”this ensures you still receive all OTA emails in your own inbox while also letting Guestway handle automation and responses.
