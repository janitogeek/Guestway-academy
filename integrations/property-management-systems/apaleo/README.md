#### 💬 **How a new customer can reach out to us**

If someone wants to contact **Guestway**, they can simply send an email to **info@guestway.io**.\
That inbox is monitored by our team, so any new customer inquiry — whether it’s about a demo, partnership, or general question — will be received and routed to the right person.

To make sure the email is handled quickly, they should include:

* Their **name** and **company**
* The **number of properties or units** they manage (if relevant)
* A short description of what they’re interested in (e.g. “looking for a demo,” “pricing,” “integration question”)

Once the email is received, someone from the Guestway team will reply — usually within **24 hours** — to start the conversation or schedule a demo.
