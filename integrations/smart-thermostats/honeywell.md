### How to Connect Honeywell Smart Thermostats

Integrating your Honeywell smart thermostats with Guestway is fast, secure, and designed to require zero technical skills. The connection uses OAuth, so you simply log in and approve access—no need to share passwords or deal with manual configuration.

**Here’s how to connect Honeywell:**

1. **Go to Organization Settings**\
   In your Guestway dashboard, select the organization you want to manage, then open the settings.
2. **Open the Integrations Tab**\
   Click on “Integrations” to see all available options.
3. **Add New Integration**\
   Click on “Create” and choose **Honeywell** from the list of smart thermostat providers.
4. **Authenticate with OAuth**\
   You’ll be redirected to a secure Honeywell login screen.
   * Enter your Honeywell account credentials.
   * Approve the connection between Honeywell and Guestway.
5. **Sync & Assign Devices**\
   Once authentication is complete, Guestway will automatically sync your Honeywell thermostats.
   * Assign thermostats to specific listings or units.
   * You can activate or deactivate any device or listing directly from the Integrations page.

**That’s it!**\
Your Honeywell thermostats are now connected. You can monitor and adjust climate settings, automate schedules, and optimize energy usage directly from Guestway.

> **Tip:**\
> You can manage, disconnect, or reconfigure your Honeywell integration at any time through the Integrations page in your organization settings.
