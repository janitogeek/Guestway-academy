### How to Connect SALTO Smart Locks&#x20;

Connecting your SALTO smart locks to Guestway is a secure and streamlined process. The integration uses OAuth, so you never need to share your password—just authorize access and you’re set.

**Here’s how to connect SALTO:**

1. **Go to Organization Settings**\
   In your Guestway dashboard, open the settings for the organization you want to connect.
2. **Open the Integrations Tab**\
   Click the “Integrations” tab to manage your available connections.
3. **Add New Integration**\
   Click on “Create” and choose **SALTO** from the list of supported smart lock providers.
4. **Authenticate with OAuth**\
   You’ll be guided through a secure OAuth authentication flow.
   * Sign in with your SALTO credentials via the pop-up window.
   * Authorize Guestway to connect to your SALTO account and manage your locks.
5. **Sync & Assign Locks**\
   Once authenticated, Guestway will automatically pull your SALTO devices and let you assign locks to specific listings.
   * You can activate or deactivate each device or listing from the Integrations page as needed.

**That’s it!**\
Your SALTO locks are now connected. Access codes, access logs, and device status will sync automatically—making access management fully integrated with your Guestway workflow.

> **Tip:**\
> You can always return to the Integrations page to manage, disconnect, or troubleshoot your SALTO integration at any time.
