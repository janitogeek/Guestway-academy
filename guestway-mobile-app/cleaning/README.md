# Cleaning

The Guestway App offers a comprehensive solution for managing **cleaning operations** in hospitality, designed to keep both managers and cleaning staff coordinated and efficient. By centralizing all cleaning-related information and tools in one place, the app helps ensure that every property is cleaned on time and perfectly prepared for incoming guests, reducing errors and delays.

The app features a Cleaning Dashboard that provides a real-time overview of cleaning schedules, team assignments, and property readiness, simplifying daily management and improving communication between teams. The Weekly Timeline View presents a clear, color-coded schedule of cleaning tasks across the week, allowing staff to prioritize urgent jobs and plan their workload effectively. Additionally, the Task Details View delivers all essential information for each cleaning assignment, including property and guest details, check-in and check-out timelines, special requests, consumables needed, and smart lock battery status, enabling accurate and timely completion of each task.

Together, these features streamline cleaning operations, enhance efficiency, and maintain high standards of service to ensure a seamless experience for both staff and guests.
