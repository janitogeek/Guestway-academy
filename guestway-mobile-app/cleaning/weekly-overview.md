# Weekly overview

The **Weekly Timeline View** in the Guestway App provides a comprehensive and easy-to-navigate overview of all cleaning tasks scheduled over the course of the week. This feature is designed to help both managers and cleaning staff plan their work efficiently by giving clear visibility into past, current, and upcoming assignments.

From the timeline, you can quickly **view all scheduled cleanings** for the current week, as well as easily navigate to the previous or next weeks to review completed tasks or prepare for future workloads. This forward and backward browsing ensures you’re always aware of what’s coming up and can make adjustments as needed.

Each cleaning task is **color-coded** according to its priority level, allowing you to instantly recognize which jobs require urgent attention versus those that are routine. For example, a high-priority check-out cleaning might be marked in red, while a standard mid-stay cleaning appears in green. This visual differentiation helps prevent overlooked tasks and supports timely completion.

Additionally, the timeline uses **intuitive icons and colored bars** to highlight important details, such as late starts, special requests, or tasks that are behind schedule. These visual cues make it easy to identify properties that need immediate focus, so teams can respond quickly to guest needs and maintain high standards of cleanliness.

For each listing, next to the property name, there is a small icon that indicates the smart lock’s battery level. If there are any reported issues with the Wi-Fi connection, this is also shown through an alert icon. These visual cues help cleaning teams and managers quickly identify potential access or connectivity problems before arriving on site.\


### **Timeline Visuals and Prompts:**

The timeline in Guestway is designed to help you efficiently manage time-sensitive cleaning tasks by visually indicating the urgency and optimal scheduling windows. Each color represents a different level of priority, allowing you to quickly assess and plan your workflow:

* **Red Line – Urgent Cleanings:** The red segment marks urgent cleaning tasks that require immediate attention and a very quick turnaround. These tasks must be completed promptly as guest arrival is imminent. Cleaning teams should work efficiently to avoid delays and ensure the property is ready on time.
* **Orange Segment – Later Cleaning Window:** The orange segment indicates tasks with medium urgency. These cleanings should be done soon to prepare the property on schedule. While not as urgent as red, timely attention is still necessary to avoid last-minute rushes
* **Light Orange Segment – Low Priority Window:** The light orange segment represents tasks with medium-low urgency. These cleanings have more flexible timing than orange but still require attention before guest arrival. This window allows for better scheduling flexibility without compromising readiness.
* **Green Segment – Ideal Cleaning Window:** The green segment marks low-priority cleaning tasks. These can be scheduled more flexibly since guest arrival is later. There’s less urgency, but these tasks should still be completed to maintain quality.
