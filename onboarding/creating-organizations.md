### What is an Organization in Guestway?

An **Organization** in Guestway is like a **workspace** that groups your listings, teams, and operations.

By default, when you create an Organization, it includes _all_ your listings. You can create as many organizations as you want, and selectively **deselect** listings to tailor each organization to your operational needs.&#x20;

You can create organizations based on different criterion.



**1. By Region (Geographically)**

**Example:**

* **East Region Organization** (only listings in your eastern area)
* **West Region Organization**
* **South Region Organization**

This allows you to assign local teams, manage region-specific operations, and keep your inbox, cleaning tasks, smart locks, and analytics clean and focused.



**2. By Building**

Create an organization for each building in your portfolio.\
**Example:**

* “123 Main Street Organization” (all listings/units within that address)\
  This is useful if you have on-site teams, building-specific access control, or unique services tied to individual properties.



**3. By Subbrand**

If your company operates under multiple brands or segments, you can create separate organizations for each subbrand.\
**Example:**

* “Luxury Suites” Organization
* “Budget Rentals” Organization
* “Corporate Stays” Organization\
  This lets you keep branding, guest communications, and reporting distinct for each brand, while sharing some team members across organizations if needed.

Additionally, Guestway includes a predefined **HQ Mode**: this acts as a master view that centralizes all your organizations into a single unified workspace, allowing you to oversee and manage all listings across your entire portfolio.
