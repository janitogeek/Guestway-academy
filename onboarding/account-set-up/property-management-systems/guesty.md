## Log-in + create your first Organization

#### What is an Organization in Guestway?

An **Organization** in Guestway is like a **workspace** that groups your listings, teams, and operations.

By default, when you create an Organization, it includes _all_ your listings. You can create as many organizations as you want, and selectively **deselect** listings to tailor each organization to your operational needs. For example:

* You may want to create regional organizations:
  * **East Region Organization** (only listings in your eastern area)
  * **West Region Organization**
  * **South Region Organization**

This allows you to assign local teams, manage region-specific operations, and keep your inbox, cleaning tasks, smart locks, and analytics clean and focused.

Additionally, Guestway includes a predefined **HQ Mode**: this acts as a master view that centralizes all your organizations into a single unified workspace, allowing you to oversee and manage all listings across your entire portfolio.
