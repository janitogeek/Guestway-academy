# Users

{% embed url="https://app.guideflow.com/player/ok8y80maxp" %}

The _**Users**_ section displays a full list of individuals who have access to the platform within your organization.&#x20;

For each user, you can see their name, email, and assigned role. If necessary, users can be removed by clicking the icon on the right.&#x20;

The platform also shows any users who have been invited but haven’t yet accepted—these are marked as "Pending Invite" along with a timestamp showing when the invitation was sent.&#x20;

To add a new team member, simply click the “Invite” button, enter their email address, and choose the role that best fits their responsibilities. Guestway offers a range of roles to match the different needs within your operation:

* Operator: This is the standard role for most users. Operators can fully manage guest communication, tasks, and day-to-day activities within the platform.
* Admin: In addition to all Operator permissions, Admins can also manage system integrations and settings. This role is suited for team leads or operations managers who handle both daily workflows and configuration.
* Super Admin: Includes all Admin capabilities, plus access to sensitive account-level controls such as billing and subscription details. Ideal for business owners or top-level executives.
* Viewer: A read-only role. Viewers can see everything happening on the platform but cannot send messages, assign tasks, or make changes. Great for audits, oversight, or training purposes.
* Cleaner: Designed specifically for on-site cleaning staff. Cleaners don’t access the main platform but use the mobile cleaning app to view tasks, update statuses, upload photos, and report issues in real time.

These roles help you manage access effectively—ensuring each team member sees only what they need to, while keeping your operation secure and organized.
