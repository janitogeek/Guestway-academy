# Branding

{% embed url="https://app.guideflow.com/player/np15w34tek" %}

The _**Branding**_ section allows you to view and customize your organization's branding settings.&#x20;

You can also create and configure new visual themes that define how your organization presents itself to guests across different touchpoints, including the Guest Portal, Main Email Communications, and Email Footers.

1. To start, under _General Information,_ you need to assign a Name to your branding profile. Optionally, you can add a Description to help distinguish it from others internally.
2. In the _Company Information_ section, you are required to fill out all core business details: Company Name, Full Address, Country, Website URL, Contact Phone, and Contact Email. These will be reflected in guest-facing interfaces and email communications.
3. Next, you must define your _Brand Colors_, including both Primary (content) and Secondary colors.&#x20;
4. Under _Brand Logos_, uploading your Main Logo is essential for proper branding. You also have the option to upload a Horizontal Logo for specific placements.
5. In the _Footer Information_ section, you're expected to enter a Signature that will appear at the bottom of emails sent from the platform.
6. Lastly, you can add links to your _Social Media accounts,_ though this is optional. These links will be accessible to your guests through various guest-facing touchpoints.
