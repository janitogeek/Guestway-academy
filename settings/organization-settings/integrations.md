# Integrations

The Integrations section allows you to manage all third-party connections related to your organization. These integrations are used to automate guest access, streamline reservation workflows, and enhance operational efficiency.&#x20;

### PMS Integration

From this page, you’ll be able to view your connected PMS. By clicking on it, you can access a tab that displays both listings and multi-units connected from your PMS to Guestway. Any new listings or multi-units created in your PMS are automatically synchronized with Guestway. This tab is purely informational, and no manual action is required.

_Listed_ indicates whether a listing or multi-unit is currently online or offline at the time you're viewing it. In the evening, more listings are typically shown as online.

_Subscribed_ means that the listing or multi-unit is actively connected to Guestway, allowing it to receive data and enable guest communication. If this option is unchecked, no conversations or reservation information will be transferred to Guestway.

### Nuki

This tab shows all Nuki smart locks currently connected to Guestway. Any new locks added in Nuki are automatically synchronized with the platform.&#x20;
