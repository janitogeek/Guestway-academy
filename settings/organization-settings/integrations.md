# Integrations

{% embed url="https://app.guideflow.com/player/8ko1g2za5r" %}

The Integrations page is where you connect Guestway to all your essential systems—[Property Management Systems (PMS)](../../onboarding/property-management-systems/), communication channels like WhatsApp, smart locks, and smart thermostats.

From this page, you can:

* **Add new integrations** (PMS, communication channels, smart locks, thermostats, etc.)
* **Activate or deactivate specific devices or listings** if you don’t want them connected to Guestway.

This centralized hub makes it easy to manage all your connections in one place—giving you full control over which platforms and devices are synced with your Guestway account.
