{% embed url="https://app.guideflow.com/player/zkjlwq7sep" %}

The Chat Widget section enables you to personalize the chat interface that can be embedded into your own website.\
From this page, you can:

* **Enable or disable** the chat widget for your properties.
* **Customize the look and feel** of the widget to match your brand.
* **Set welcome messages** and automated responses for guests.

This gives you full control over the guest messaging experience directly from your Guestway dashboard.
