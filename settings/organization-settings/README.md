# Organization Settings

The **Organization Settings** section allows administrators and managers to configure and control how Guestway operates across the entire organization. These settings ensure that your team, branding, integrations, and communications are consistent and optimized for your business needs. This area includes several key sections:

In the _**General**_ tab, you can view and update your organization’s core information.&#x20;

This includes the organization name, the public URL, the default language used by the AI assistant, and any AI-adaptable languages you want to enable to support multilingual guest interactions.

The _**Branding**_ section allows you to view and customize your organization's branding settings.&#x20;

You can also create and configure new visual themes that define how your organization presents itself to guests across different touchpoints, including the Guest Portal, Main Email Communications, and Email Footers.

1. To start, under _General Information,_ you need to assign a Name to your branding profile. Optionally, you can add a Description to help distinguish it from others internally.
2. In the _Company Information_ section, you are required to fill out all core business details: Company Name, Full Address, Country, Website URL, Contact Phone, and Contact Email. These will be reflected in guest-facing interfaces and email communications.
3. Next, you must define your _Brand Colors_, including both Primary (content) and Secondary colors.&#x20;
4. Under _Brand Logos_, uploading your Main Logo is essential for proper branding. You also have the option to upload a Horizontal Logo for specific placements.
5. In the _Footer Information_ section, you're expected to enter a Signature that will appear at the bottom of emails sent from the platform.
6. Lastly, you can add links to your _Social Media accounts,_ though this is optional. These links will be accessible to your guests through various guest-facing touchpoints.

The _**Chat Widget**_ section enables you to personalize the chat interface that can be embedded into your own website.

In _**Email Forwarding**_, you can manage how your OTA-related emails are handled.&#x20;

The _Email Reception_ feature provides you with a unique Guestway email address that can be added to platforms like Airbnb or Booking.com. When those platforms send reservation or guest communication emails, Guestway will automatically receive and process them.

The _Email Forwarding_ feature allows you to define a destination email address where Guestway will forward all incoming messages—this ensures you still receive all OTA emails in your own inbox while also letting Guestway handle automation and responses.

The _**Users**_ section displays a full list of individuals who have access to the platform within your organization.&#x20;

For each user, you can see their name, email, and assigned role. If necessary, users can be removed by clicking the icon on the right.&#x20;

The platform also shows any users who have been invited but haven’t yet accepted—these are marked as "Pending Invite" along with a timestamp showing when the invitation was sent.&#x20;

To add a new team member, simply click the “Invite” button, enter their email address, and choose the role that best fits their responsibilities. Guestway offers a range of roles to match the different needs within your operation:

* Operator: This is the standard role for most users. Operators can fully manage guest communication, tasks, and day-to-day activities within the platform.
* Admin: In addition to all Operator permissions, Admins can also manage system integrations and settings. This role is suited for team leads or operations managers who handle both daily workflows and configuration.
* Super Admin: Includes all Admin capabilities, plus access to sensitive account-level controls such as billing and subscription details. Ideal for business owners or top-level executives.
* Viewer: A read-only role. Viewers can see everything happening on the platform but cannot send messages, assign tasks, or make changes. Great for audits, oversight, or training purposes.
* Cleaner: Designed specifically for on-site cleaning staff. Cleaners don’t access the main platform but use the mobile cleaning app to view tasks, update statuses, upload photos, and report issues in real time.

These roles help you manage access effectively—ensuring each team member sees only what they need to, while keeping your operation secure and organized.
