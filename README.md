<p align="center">Looking to get started with Guestway?</p>

<p align="center"><a href="https://meetings.hubspot.com/jim-bleys/demo-guestway?uuid=d10a447d-9aed-42a7-a93f-e51fa87ae389">Book a demo</a> or contact us at jim@guestway.io for personnalized guidance.</p>

## Basics:

1️⃣  We’ll send you a **personalized invitation link** to create your account.

{% content-ref url="onboarding/sign-up-registration.md" %}
[sign-up-registration.md](onboarding/sign-up-registration.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

2️⃣ Once you’ve completed the sign-up, you’ll log into your brand new Guestway account and **create your first Organization** 🏢

{% content-ref url="onboarding/creating-organizations.md" %}
[creating-organizations.md](onboarding/creating-organizations.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

3️⃣ After that, you’ll be guided to **connect your PMS** 🔗

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Once your PMS is connected, Guestway will start pulling all the relevant data and you’re ready to get started! 🚀
