# Overview

#### ðŸ§  What is Guestway?

**Guestway is an all-in-one smart hospitality platform built to streamline operations, elevate guest experiences, and enable scalable growth for property managers and hospitality businesses.**

Born out of real operational pain, Guestway was developed by a fast-growing property management company ([Stay C](https://stayc.be)) that outgrew its fragmented stack of tools. Instead of yet another disconnected solution, Guestway was designed as a centralized operating system that overlays and enhances your existing setupâ€”working _with_ your PMS, not replacing it.

#### ðŸ’¼ Who is it for?

Guestway is built for:

* **Property Management Companies (PMCs)** of all sizes, from boutique operators with a handful of listings to enterprise players managing hundreds of properties.
* **Hospitality brands** seeking operational excellence and a branded guest experience.
* **Teams overwhelmed by manual processes**, disjointed tools, and the complexity of modern short-term rental operations.

If your business is growing and your current tech stack feels like a patchwork of workarounds, Guestway is for you.
