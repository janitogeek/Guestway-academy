# What is Guestway?

Guestway is a modern SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) platform designed for the hospitality and short-term rental industry. It’s built to complement your existing Property Management System by adding powerful tools that streamline operations, automate workflows, and enhance the guest experience.

Rather than replacing your PMS, Guestway works in sync with it—bringing together communication, task management, smart device integration, and performance tracking into one centralized, cloud-based platform.

Fully modular and scalable, Guestway is suitable for hospitality businesses of any size—from small teams managing a few properties to large operators overseeing hundreds across multiple cities. It provides the operational control and flexibility needed to grow efficiently while maintaining high-quality service standards.
